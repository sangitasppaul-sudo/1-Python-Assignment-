        "# **1. What is Python, and why is it popular?**\n",
        "  -  Python is a High-level, interpreted programming language known for its simplicity and readability. Large standard Library: Python comes with a comprehensive standard library that provides support for various tasks without the need for addirional installations. Versatility: Python is a general-purpose language, meaning it can be used for a wide range of applications, including web development, data analysis, artificial intelligence, machine learning, automatuon, scientific, computing. Easy to learn and read: Python emphasizea readability and simplicity, making it an excellent choice for beginners. its clean syntax reduces the cost of program maintence and development. Interpretation and compitation: Python is an interpreted language, which means code is executed line by line, making it easier to debug and test. However, Python can also be compiled into bytecode for impreved performance using tools like Pytnstaller, Cython or Nuitka. Dynamic typing: Python uses dynamic typing, meaning you don't need to declare variable tupes explicity. This flexibility allows for rapid development and prototypoing. Cummunity support: Python has a vast and active community of developers who contribute to its ecosystem by creating libaries, framework, and tools, This community support make it easy to find solutuons to problems, learn new technique, and collaborate on project.\n",
        "  - **Python is Popular because-**\n",
        "Easy to Learn & Readable- Simple syntax makes it beginner-friendly. Extensive Libraries & Frameworks- Huge collection of modules (like NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, TensorFlow, Django) saves time. Versatile & General Purpose- Used in web development, data science, AI/ML, automation, game development, IoT, scripting, etc. Cross-Platform & Open Source- Works on Windows, Mac, Linux without modification. Free and supported by a large community. Strong Community Support- Millions of developers, tutorials, and open-source contributions make problem-solving easier. Integration & Extensibility- Works well with other languages (C, C++, Java) and databases (SQL, MongoDB).\n",

        "# **2. What is an interpreter in Python?**\n",
        "  - An interpreter in Python executes code line by line, making Python easier to debug, test, and run across multiple platforms without compilation. 1. An interpreter is a program that executes Python code line by line, instead of compiling the whole program at once. 2. Python is an interpreted language, which means code is directly executed by the interpreter without needing a separate compilation step. **it Works**-1. You write Python code in a .py file. 2. The Python interpreter reads the code one line at a time. 3. It translates it into bytecode, which is then executed by the Python Virtual Machine (PVM). **Advantages of Using an Interpreter** 1. Easy debugging → Errors are caught immediately when that line is executed. 2. Cross-platform → Same Python code runs on Windows, Mac, Linux. 3.Interactive mode → You can test code quickly in the Python shell/IDLE.\n",

        "#  **3. What are pre-defined keywords in Python?**\n",
        "  - Predefined keywords in Python are reserved words with special meaning, used to define the structure and flow of the program. Predefined Keywords in Python. Keywords are special reserved words in Python. They have fixed meaning and purpose in the language. We cannot use them as variable names, function names, or identifiers. They help define the syntax and structure of Python programs. **Examples of Keywords **(Python 3.10+, 35 in total) False, True, None, and, or, not, if, elif, else, while, for, break, continue, pass, def, class, return, yield, lambda, try, except, finally, raise, assert, import, from, as, with, global, nonlocal, del, in, is, async, await. Use in Programs\n",

        "    - def greet(): if True: return \"Hello\" else: pass\n",
        "\n",
        "    - print(greet()) # Output: Hello Here: • def → defines a function • if / else → conditional • return → sends value back • pass → placeholder\n",
        "\n",
        "# **4. Can keywords be used as variable names?**\n",
        "  - Keywords cannot be used as variable names in Python because they are reserved for special purposes in the language syntax. Keywords are reserved words in Python. They have a special meaning and are used to define the syntax or logic of the program. If you try to use a keyword as a variable name, Python will throw a SyntaxError. Example Trying to use a keyword as a variable for = 10 print(for) Error: SyntaxError: invalid syntax, Because - keywords already tell Python what action to perform (for, if, def, etc.). If they were allowed as variable names, the interpreter would get confused between your variable and Python’s reserved meaning.\n",
        "\n",
        "# **5. What is mutability in Python?**\n",
        "  - Mutability means whether an object’s value can be changed (modified) after it is created. In Python, some data types are mutable (can change), while others are immutable (cannot change).\n",
        "  **Mutable Objects** - Values can be changed without changing the object’s identity (memory address). Examples: list, dict, set, bytearray numbers = [1, 2, 3] print(id(numbers)) # memory address before numbers.append(4) # modify list print(numbers) # [1, 2, 3, 4] print(id(numbers)) # same memory address (mutable). **Immutable Objects** Once created, values cannot be changed. Any “change” creates a new object with a different memory address. Examples: int, float, string, tuple, frozenset, bool x = \"hello\" print(id(x)) # memory address before x = x + \" world\" # creates a new string print(x) # hello world print(id(x)) # different memory address (immutable)\n",
        "\n",
        "# **6. Why are lists mutable, but tuples are immutable?**\n",
        "  - Lists are designed to store collections of items that may change. You can add, remove, or modify elements without creating a new list. Internally, Python gives lists a dynamic memory structure that allows resizing and modification. Example - fruits = [\"apple\", \"banana\", \"cherry\"] fruits[1] = \"mango\" # modify element fruits.append(\"grape\") # add element print(fruits) # ['apple', 'mango', 'cherry', 'grape'] **Tuples in Python are immutable because** - 1. Tuples are designed to represent fixed collections of items. 2. Once created, their values cannot change (no add, remove, or update). 3. Internally, Python fixes the memory allocation of a tuple, making it safe for hashing (so tuples can be used as keys in dictionaries, unlike lists).Example: colors = (\"red\", \"green\", \"blue\") colors[1] = \"yellow\" # Error: 'tuple' object does not support item assignment Key Reason for the Difference • Lists → meant for dynamic data that changes. • Tuples → meant for static data that stays fixed. This design choice helps Python balance flexibility (lists) and safety/performance (tuples).\n",

        "  - **== Operator (Equality Operator)** 1. Checks whether the values of two objects are equal.2. It does not care about memory location, only compares contents. Example: x = [1, 2, 3] y = [1, 2, 3]\n",
        "  print(x == y) # True (values are same) print(x is y) # False (different memory addresses).\n",
        "  **is Operator (Identity Operator)** 1. Checks whether two variables point to the same object in memory. 2. In other words, it compares object identity, not content. Example: a = \"hello\" b = \"hello\"\n",
        "  print(a == b) # True (same content) print(a is b) # True (sometimes same memory due to string interning)\n",
        "\n",
        "# **8. What are logical operators in Python?**\n",
        "  - Logical Operators in Python Logical operators are used to combine conditional statements and return Boolean values (True or False). Python has three logical operators:\n",
        "  **1. and**- Returns True if both conditions are True. Otherwise, returns False. x = 5 print(x > 0 and x < 10) # True (both conditions are True) print(x > 0 and x > 10) # False (second condition is False)\n",
        "  **2. or**- Returns True if at least one condition is True. Returns False only if both conditions are False. x = 5 print(x < 0 or x > 0) # True (second condition is True) print(x < 0 or x < 3) # False (both False).\n",
        "  **3. not**- Returns the opposite of the Boolean value. True → False, False → True x = True y = False print(not x) # False print(not y) # True\n",
        "\n",
        "# **9. What is type casting in Python?**\n",
        "  - Type casting (or type conversion) means converting a variable from one data type to another. • It allows you to perform operations between different types of data. Python supports two types of type casting:\n",
        "  **Implicit Type Casting (Automatic)** Done automatically by Python. Converts smaller data type → larger data type to avoid data loss. a = 5 # int b = 2.5 # float c = a + b # int + float → float automatically print(c) # 7.5 print(type(c)) # <class 'float'>\n",
        "  **Explicit Type Casting (Manual)** Done manually by the programmer using built-in functions: Function Converts To Example int(x) Integer int(3.7) → 3 float(x) Float float(5) → 5.0 str(x) String str(25) → \"25\" list(x) List list((1,2)) → [1,2] tuple(x) Tuple tuple([1,2]) → (1,2) set(x) Set set([1,2,2]) → {1,2} x = \"100\" y = int(x) # string → int z = float(y) # int → float print(y, type(y)) # 100 <class 'int'> print(z, type(z)) # 100.0 <class 'float'>\n",

        "# **11. What is the purpose of conditional statements in Python?**\n",
        "  - Purpose of Conditional Statements in Python Conditional statements allow the program to make decisions and execute certain blocks of code only if specific conditions are met. In Python, these include: if , elif , else.\n",
        "  Purpose of key- **1. Decision Making:** Conditional statements help the program choose different paths based on certain conditions. age = 18 if age >= 18: print(\"You can vote\") else: print(\"You cannot vote\") **2. Control Program Flow:** They allow selective execution of code instead of running everything sequentially. **3. Implement Real-World Logic:**  Used to implement business rules, validations, and logic like login authentication, discounts, etc. **4. Reduce Redundancy:** Avoids writing separate code for every possible case by handling multiple scenarios in a single structure.\n",
        "\n",
        "# **12. How does the Elif statement work?**\n",
        "  - elif stands for “else if”. It is used in conditional statements to check multiple conditions after an initial if. If the if condition is False, Python checks the elif condition(s) in order. If an elif condition is True, its block executes, and Python skips the rest.\n",
        "  Syntax- if condition1: # execute block1 elif condition2: # execute block2 elif condition3: # execute block3 else: # execute block4 • You can have multiple elif blocks. • The else block is optional and executes if all previous conditions are False.\n",
        "  Example marks = 75\n",
        "  if marks >= 90: print(\"Grade A\") elif marks >= 75: print(\"Grade B\") elif marks >= 60: print(\"Grade C\") else: print(\"Fail\") Output: Grade B • if marks >= 90 → False • elif marks >= 75 → True → Executes this block • Remaining elif and else → Skipped\n",

        "  **1.Initialization**\n",
        "  for loop: Initialization is usually done in the loop itself (like iterating over a sequence or range).\n",
        "  while loop: Initialization must be done separately before the loop starts.\n",
        "  **2.Condition**\n",
        "  for loop: Works with a sequence (range, list, string, etc.) and stops automatically when the sequence ends.\n",
        "  while loop: Runs until a given condition becomes False.\n",
        "  **3. Iteration Control**\n",
        "  for loop: Automatically handles increment/decrement when iterating through a sequence.\n",
        "  while loop: Programmer must manually update the loop variable to avoid infinite loops.\n",
        "  **4. Usage**\n",
        "  for loop: Best when the number of iterations is known.\n",
        "  while loop: Best when the number of iterations is not known in advance and depends on a condition.\n",
        "  **5. Readability**\n",
        "  for loop: More concise and easier to read for definite iteration.\n",
        "  while loop: Can become longer since initialization, condition, and increment are separate.\n",
        "  **6. Infinite Loop Possibility**\n",
        "  for loop: Less prone to infinite loops (unless break is misused).\n",
        "  while loop: More prone to infinite loops if the condition never becomes False.\n",
        "\n",
        "# **14. Describe a scenario where a while loop is more suitable than a for loop.**\n",
        "  - Scenario where a while loop is more suitable than a for loop:\n",
        "  A while loop is more suitable when the number of iterations is not known in advance and the loop should continue running until a certain condition is met.\n",
        "  For example, consider a situation where a program repeatedly asks a user to enter a password until they enter the correct one. In this case, we don’t know how many attempts the user will take. A for loop is not ideal here because it usually runs for a fixed number of iterations. Instead, a while loop is best since it continues until the condition (correct password entered) becomes true.\n",
        "  **Explanation:**\n",
        "  for loop works well when the number of repetitions is predetermined (like printing numbers from 1 to 10).\n",
        "  while loop is better when the repetitions depend on a condition that may change during program execution (like waiting for user input, reading data until end-of-file, or monitoring a sensor until it reaches a threshold)."
